# SQL

This was a personal project that used the Youtube API to pull channel statistics and perform an analysis on them. From this, a dashboard is going to be built using these SQL queries. 

While it is a relatively short project, important features like CTE's and Windows functions are displayed, along with minor data engineering. 

This project was split between Python, calling the API, getting, the data and cleaning it, exporting to an excel csv file, and then using MySQL to create a database and query the data for Tableau visualization.
